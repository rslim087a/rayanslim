# Welcome to the Prometheus Course

**Ever wished you could see exactly what your apps and infrastructure are doing—right now?**

In this hands-on course, you’ll turn a blind-spot stack into a **clear, actionable observability system**. Starting with raw metrics and no dashboards, you’ll assemble Prometheus, Grafana, and exporters into a cohesive pipeline that turns signals into insight.

You’ll wire up **metrics endpoints**, define **smart scraping rules**, and craft **PromQL queries** that answer real questions. Then you’ll build **Grafana dashboards** that surface what matters and set up **alerts** that reach the right people at the right time. By the end, you’ll have a complete monitoring workflow that any DevOps team would trust.

**What makes this course special?** You’ll see results at every step. Each configuration change immediately shapes what you can observe—making concepts click through real feedback loops and live data.

Ready to turn noise into clarity—and dashboards into decisions? Let’s dive in!
