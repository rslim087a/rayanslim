# Welcome to Keycloak SSO Course

**Ever wonder how companies let employees sign in once and access every application?**

In this hands-on course, you'll implement **enterprise-grade single sign-on** using Keycloak and OpenID Connect. Starting with Grafana that requires separate login credentials, you'll transform it into a system where users sign in once through Keycloak and automatically get the right permissions everywhere.

You'll build the complete **authentication flow**  from user clicking "Sign in with SSO" to being redirected back with **proper roles and permissions**. Watch as Keycloak becomes your **identity bouncer**, checking credentials and issuing **access tokens** and **ID tokens** that tell applications not just "let this user in" but also "here's who they are and what they can do."

**What makes OpenID Connect powerful?** Unlike simple OAuth that just grants access, OpenID Connect also provides **identity information**. Your applications don't just know someone is authorized  they know exactly who that person is and what role to give them (admin, editor, viewer).

Ready to build professional identity management that scales across your entire application ecosystem? Let's create your SSO system!
