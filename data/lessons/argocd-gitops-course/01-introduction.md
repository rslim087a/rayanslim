# Welcome to Argo CD Course

**Ever wished your Kubernetes cluster stayed perfectly in sync with Git—automatically?**

In this hands-on course, you’ll turn a plain repo into a **single source of truth** for your cluster. You’ll wire up Argo CD so every commit becomes a safe, auditable change in Kubernetes—no manual kubectl needed.

You’ll create **continuous delivery pipelines** with Argo CD Applications, scale cleanly with **Kustomize overlays** for dev/stage/prod, and ship complex apps using **Helm**—all driven by Git. By the end, you’ll have a GitOps workflow that’s easy to reason about, review, and roll back.

**What makes this course special?** You’ll see updates propagate live from Git to cluster, so the benefits of GitOps click immediately—traceable changes, drift detection, and self-healing.

Ready to let Git drive your deployments and let Argo CD keep everything in sync? Let’s dive in!
