# Welcome to AWS Cloud Course

**Ever wondered how to build a real production-ready serverless application from scratch?**

In this hands-on course, you'll build the complete serverless architecture that powers modern web applications. Starting from zero, you'll create **CloudTask** - a full-stack task management app that combines **S3 static hosting**, **CloudFront CDN**, **Cognito authentication**, **Lambda functions**, **API Gateway REST APIs**, and **DynamoDB database storage**.

You'll learn the serverless concepts that power cost-effective, infinitely scalable applications – **static website hosting**, **global content delivery**, **user authentication and authorization**, **serverless backend functions**, **REST API creation**, and **NoSQL data modeling**.

**What makes this course special?** Every AWS service is immediately put into practice as part of a cohesive system. You'll see how S3 hosts your frontend files, how CloudFront delivers them globally with HTTPS, how Cognito manages user authentication, how API Gateway secures your endpoints, how Lambda processes business logic, and how DynamoDB stores application data. By the end, you'll have a production-ready web application accessible from anywhere in the world.

Ready to stop building toy projects and start deploying real cloud applications? Let's dive in!
