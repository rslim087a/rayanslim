# Welcome to Serverless Course

**Ever wondered how to build APIs without managing servers?**

In this hands-on course, you'll discover the serverless architecture that's revolutionizing how modern applications scale. Starting from scratch, you'll create a **Lambda function** that executes code on-demand, expose it through **API Gateway** to make it accessible from anywhere, and build a real QR code generator that only runs—and costs you—when actually called.

You'll learn the serverless concepts that power cost-effective, infinitely scalable applications – **event-driven computing**, **pay-per-use pricing**, **automatic scaling**, and the critical difference between **traditional servers and serverless functions**.

**What makes this course special?** Every concept is immediately put into practice. You'll see how Lambda eliminates server management, how API Gateway routes requests to your functions, and how serverless architecture automatically scales from zero to millions of requests. By the end, you'll have a production-ready API accessible from any HTTP client.

Ready to stop paying for idle servers and start building infrastructure that scales automatically? Let's dive in!
