# Welcome to the Tempo Course

**Ever wondered what really happens to a request as it hops across dozens of microservices?**

In this hands-on course, you’ll transform invisible request journeys into a **clear tracing system**. Starting with a multi-service simulation, you’ll set up Tempo and Alloy to capture every span of a request and connect it all in Grafana.

You’ll learn to **analyze traces**, **spot bottlenecks**, and **visualize service dependencies** with service graphs. You’ll also master Grafana’s trace explorer and advanced drill-down plugins to pinpoint slow operations and errors in seconds. By the end, you’ll have a complete tracing workflow that bridges metrics with traces for full-stack observability.

**What makes this course special?** You’ll see bottlenecks appear in real time as traces light up your dashboards, making performance issues obvious and distributed systems easier to reason about.

Ready to turn complex microservice chains into clear insights? Let’s dive in!
