# Welcome to Relational Database Course

**Ever wondered how to set up a production-ready relational database in the cloud?**

In this hands-on course, you'll discover how Amazon RDS eliminates database administration headaches while giving you full SQL capabilities. Starting from scratch, you'll create a **MySQL database instance** in AWS, configure security groups to control access, and connect a **Python application** that creates tables and performs real SQL queries.

You'll learn the database concepts that power reliable, scalable applications – **RDS instance configuration**, **security group rules**, **VPC connectivity**, **database connection strings**, and the critical difference between **public and private database access**.

**What makes this course special?** Every concept is immediately put into practice. You'll see how RDS handles backups and maintenance automatically, how security groups protect your database from unauthorized access, and how to write Python code that safely connects to and queries your database. By the end, you'll have a working MySQL database with a Python API that performs real CRUD operations.

Ready to stop managing database servers manually and start using AWS's fully managed relational database service? Let's dive in!
