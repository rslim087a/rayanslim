# Welcome to the Kubernetes CI/CD Course

**Ever wished your code changes shipped themselves—safely and automatically?**

In this hands-on course, you’ll wire together GitHub Actions and Argo CD to turn every commit into a **reproducible, auditable deployment**. You’ll watch images get built, pushed, versioned, and rolled out to Kubernetes—no manual steps, no mystery.

You’ll create **automated build pipelines**, set up a **GitOps deployment flow** that reconciles desired vs. actual state, and learn how to secure and troubleshoot the path from code to cluster. By the end, you’ll have a complete CI/CD system you can reuse for real projects.

**What makes this course special?** You’ll see the pipeline working at every stage—image build, registry push, GitOps update, and cluster sync—so the whole flow “clicks” through hands-on results.

Ready to go from commit to Kubernetes automatically and reliably? Let’s dive in!
