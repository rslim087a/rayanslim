# Welcome to Kong API Gateway Course

**Tired of using port forwarding to access your Kubernetes APIs?**

In this hands-on course, you'll transform a simple internal API that requires port forwarding into a **production-ready external service** that the world can access. But that's just the beginning  you'll also turn Kong into your API's personal **bouncer**.

Starting with an API that's locked away inside your cluster, you'll install Kong and watch as your service becomes externally accessible. Then you'll add **API key authentication** so only authorized users can get through, and finally implement **rate limiting** to prevent any single user from overwhelming your service.

**What makes Kong special?** While other ingress controllers are just doors, Kong is a **door with a smart bouncer**  it doesn't just let traffic through, it checks credentials and enforces rules. You'll see each security layer activate in real-time as unauthorized requests get blocked and rate limits kick in.

Ready to turn your internal APIs into secure, professional-grade services? Let's build your API fortress!
