# Welcome to the Loki Course

**Ever wondered how to make sense of millions of logs without drowning in them?**

In this hands-on course, you’ll transform raw, scattered logs into a **streamlined observability system**. Starting from Kubernetes workloads that generate endless log lines, you’ll set up Loki to store and query them efficiently, and then connect everything into Grafana for powerful visualizations.

You’ll learn how to **collect logs with Promtail**, **query them with LogQL**, and **combine them with Prometheus metrics** inside a single Grafana dashboard. By the end, you’ll be able to detect anomalies through metrics and instantly diagnose them with the corresponding logs—all in one place.

**What makes this course special?** Each step produces a visible result: logs flowing into Loki, metrics correlating with log events, and dashboards coming alive. Complex observability concepts click immediately when you see them in action.

Ready to turn noisy logs into clear insights? Let’s dive in!
