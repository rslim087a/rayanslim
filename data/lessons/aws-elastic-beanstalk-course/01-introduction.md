# Welcome to Platform as a Service Course

**Ever wondered how to deploy applications without spending hours configuring servers?**

In this hands-on course, you'll discover the Platform as a Service (PaaS) approach that eliminates infrastructure headaches. Starting from scratch, you'll deploy a **real Node.js web application** to Elastic Beanstalk and watch AWS automatically create EC2 instances, security groups, and monitoring—all without touching a single server configuration file.

You'll learn the deployment concepts that separate manual infrastructure management from modern PaaS workflows – **automatic provisioning**, **environment variables**, **single instance vs load-balanced architectures**, and the critical difference between **managing servers yourself versus letting the platform handle it**.

**What makes this course special?** Every concept is immediately put into practice. You'll see how Beanstalk creates infrastructure automatically, how environment variables configure applications without code changes, and how to explore the EC2 instances and security groups that Beanstalk provisions behind the scenes. By the end, you'll have a live web application accessible from anywhere on the internet.

Ready to stop babysitting servers and start deploying applications the fast way? Let's dive in!
