# Welcome to Cloud Servers Course

**Ever wondered how to launch your own server in the cloud?**

In this hands-on course, you'll build the networking foundation that powers every AWS application. Starting from scratch, you'll create a **custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** that isolates your resources, carve out **public subnets** for internet-facing servers, and launch an **EC2 instance** that you can connect to directly from your laptop.

You'll learn the networking concepts that separate hobbyist deployments from production infrastructure – **regions and availability zones**, **CIDR blocks and IP addressing**, **internet gateways and route tables**, and the critical difference between **public and private subnets**.

**What makes this course special?** Every concept is immediately put into practice. You'll see how VPCs create isolated networks, how subnets organize resources by availability zone, and how SSH key pairs secure access to your servers. By the end, you'll have a running web server accessible from anywhere on the internet.

Ready to stop using AWS's default network and start building infrastructure the right way? Let's dive in!
