# Welcome to RBAC Course

**Ever wondered how to secure your Kubernetes APIs properly?** 

In this hands-on course, you'll transform a completely open API that anyone can access into a **fortress of security**. Starting with an API that freely accepts any request, you'll build layer upon layer of protection using Kubernetes' powerful security features.

You'll create **digital identity badges**, set up **smart gatekeepers** that validate every request, and learn to grant just the right permissions – no more, no less. By the end, you'll have built a complete security system that would make any DevOps team proud.

**What makes this course special?** You'll see immediate results at every step. Each security layer you add will visibly change how your system behaves, making complex concepts crystal clear through hands-on experience.

Ready to turn your APIs from wide-open doors into secure, controlled access points? Let's dive in!
