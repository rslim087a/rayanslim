## 1. Create an AWS Account

Go to the [AWS homepage](https://aws.amazon.com).

In the top right corner, click on **"Create an AWS Account"** or **"Sign Up"**. If you see "Sign In" instead, click it and then look for an option to create a new account.

Follow the prompts to create your account:

- Provide an email address and AWS account name
- Create a password
- Enter your contact information. If prompted to select an account type, choose **'personal'**.
- Provide a valid credit card for billing (you won't be charged for free tier services)
- Verify your identity
- Choose a support plan (**Basic** is free and sufficient for most users)
