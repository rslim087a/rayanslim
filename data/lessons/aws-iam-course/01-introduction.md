# **Ready to start building on AWS?**

Before you can deploy anything on Amazon Web Services, you need a properly configured development environment. In this hands-on course, you'll set up your AWS account the right way – using IAM users instead of your root account, and installing the AWS CLI so you can control everything from your terminal.

You'll create a **secure IAM user** with the right permissions, generate **access keys** for authentication, and configure the **AWS CLI** on your local machine. This is the foundation that every AWS tutorial assumes you already have in place.

**What makes this course essential?** Without this setup, you can't follow any AWS course or tutorial. Whether you're deploying containers, setting up databases, or configuring cloud infrastructure, it all starts here.

**The best part?** This takes less than 10 minutes to complete, and you'll use this same setup for every AWS project you build.

Ready to get your AWS environment configured correctly? Let's get started!
